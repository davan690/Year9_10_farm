Student Mission Checklist: Spring/Summer Edition

Welcome to the farm! Your mission is to ensure the health of our animals, the productivity of our crops, and the health of our ecosystem. Complete these tasks to earn your "Farm Steward" status.

   * [ ] Optional: Gently pat a chicken.


* [ ] Paddock Animal Check:
   * [ ] Scrub out the water trough and refill with clean water.
   * [ ] Spread fresh wood shavings in the shelter bedding area.
   * [ ] Place a scoop of nuts in the wooden trough for a snack.


Mission Area 2: Garden & Berry House Maintenance


The Watering Run:

   * [ ] Gently turn the topsoil to aerate it for new growth.


The Berry House Mission:

   * [ ] Apply a fresh layer of wood chips to suppress future weeds and hold moisture.


Planting & Propagation:
   * [ ] Check the seed raising tray in the tunnel house.
   * [ ] Use a spray bottle to dampen the soil of any emerging seedlings.


Mission Area 3: Restoration & Tree Health


Gorse Removal:
   * [ ] Gear up: Wear heavy-duty gloves and grab the loppers.
   * [ ] Head to the hillside behind the poplars at the top of the farm.
   * [ ] Cut gorse back to the base and pile it neatly for disposal.


Young Tree Audit:
   * [ ] Walk the farm perimeter and check all newly planted trees.
   * [ ] Check: Are they still alive? Are the protective covers/guards secure?
   * [ ] Pull any grass or weeds growing inside the tree guards.
Mission Area 4: Environmental Observation




The Stream Study:
   * [ ] Look: Is the water clear or murky? Is it flowing fast or slow?
   * [ ] Listen: Can you hear the water? Can you identify any bird calls nearby?
   * [ ] Smell & Feel: Does the air smell damp? Is it cooler here than in the open paddock?




Bee Watch:
   * [ ] Stand to the side of the hive (stay out of the flight path!).
   * [ ] The Minute Count: How many bees leave the hive in 60 seconds? How many return?




Mission Area 5: Organisation & Inventory




The Great Tidy-Up:
   * [ ] Barn & Shed: Sweep the floors and return all tools to their specific hooks or racks.
   * [ ] Wood Pile: Re-stack the wood pile behind the 'toilet' area so it is neat and safe.
   * [ ] Pot Sort: Head behind the barn. Organise the pots by size and stack them neatly.


Tool Audit:
   * [ ] Clean all dirt off tools used today.
   * [ ] Ensure all watering cans and buckets are stored upside down (to prevent mosquito breeding).










The Compost Flip:
* [ ] Collect pitchforks from the shed.
* [ ] "Turn" the compost. Get some from another Bin to help it break down - use a wheelbarrow if needed.
* [ ] Replace all covers to keep the heat in.
* [ ] Clean the forks by wiping them on the grass before putting them away.


Final Mission
* [ ] Mission Debrief: Write a 2-sentence summary of the most interesting thing you observed or the biggest job you tackled today.
