Describe the sound - [ ] Can you identify any bird calls nearby? - [ ] What other sounds do you notice in this area? - [ ] Is it quieter or noisier than other parts of the farm?\nSensory Assessment: - [ ] Smell & Feel: Does the air smell damp? - [ ] Is it cooler here than in the open paddock? - [ ] Is there a breeze? From which direction? - [ ] How does the vegetation differ near the stream?\nWater Quality Indicators: - Clear water = healthy stream - Murky water = recent rain, erosion, or pollution - Presence of aquatic insects = good water quality - Variety of bird species = healthy ecosystem\nRecording Tips: - Take photos at the same spot each visit - Note the date, time, and weather conditions - Compare your observations to previous visits - Report any concerns (pollution, dead fish, etc.)"

Are the protective covers/guards secure?\nPull any grass or weeds growing inside the tree guards\nStraighten any leaning stakes\nTighten any loose tree ties\nNote any trees that need replacement\n\nWhat to Look For: - Alive: Green leaves/buds, flexible branches, healthy bark - Dead/Dying: Brown leaves, brittle branches, damaged bark - Guards: Should be secure, upright, and properly ventilated - Weeds: Competition for water and nutrients - remove completely\nTree Care Tips: - Remove weeds within 50cm radius of each tree - Ensure guards don’t rub against tree bark - Tree ties should be secure but not too tight - Water young trees during dry periods if possible"
