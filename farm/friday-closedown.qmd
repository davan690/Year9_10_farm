## Mission Area 4: Environmental Observation

### The Stream Study:
- [ ] Look: Is the water clear or murky? Is it flowing fast or slow?
- [ ] Listen: Can you hear the water? Can you identify any bird calls nearby?
- [ ] Smell & Feel: Does the air smell damp? Is it cooler here than in the open paddock?

### Bee Watch:
- [ ] Stand to the side of the hive (stay out of the flight path!)
- [ ] The Minute Count: How many bees leave the hive in 60 seconds? How many return?
- [ ] Record your observations for next week's comparison
