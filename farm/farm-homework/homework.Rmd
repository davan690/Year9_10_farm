### Step 1: Create Your Map

2. Create a new map and name it "Kaikorai Valley College School Farm".
3. Set up two layers:
   - **Existing** for current features (paddocks, dams, fences, buildings, water points).
   - **Proposed** for planned work (new planting, new fencing, new water lines).
4. Add features using the toolbar:
   - **Markers** for points (sheds, tanks, troughs, gates).
   - **Lines** for fences, tracks, or waterways.
   - **Areas** for paddocks or blocks.
5. Use the **Measurement tool** (ruler icon) to check at least one distance and one paddock area.
6. Add these map elements:
   - **Arrow (north)** for direction.
   - **Scale** to show distances.
   - **Legend** that explains your symbols and colors.
