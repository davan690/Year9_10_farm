# README for Farm Homework Project

## Overview

Welcome to the Farm Homework project! This project is designed for Year 9/10 students in New Zealand to learn about mapping and geography using Google My Maps and RMarkdown. The project consists of two main files: `index.Rmd` and `homework.Rmd`.

### Purpose

- **index.Rmd**: This file provides step-by-step instructions for students to create a map of the school farm using Google My Maps. It covers how to set up layers, draw features, measure distances, and export the map.

- **homework.Rmd**: This file contains the homework assignment where students will generate a PDF map of the farm. They will be required to add an arrow, scale, and legend to their map, as well as answer two short questions related to the mapping activity.

### How to Use

1. **Creating the Map**: Start by following the instructions in `index.Rmd` to create your farm map using Google My Maps. Make sure to save your map once you have added all the necessary features.

2. **Completing the Homework**: After creating your map, open `homework.Rmd` to complete the homework assignment. Follow the instructions to generate a PDF version of your map and answer the questions provided.

### Setup Instructions

- Ensure you have access to Google My Maps by signing in with your Google account.
- Familiarize yourself with the RMarkdown format if you are not already accustomed to it. You can use RStudio or any compatible editor to work with the RMarkdown files.
