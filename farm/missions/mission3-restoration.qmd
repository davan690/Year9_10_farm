## Overview

Your mission is to protect and maintain the farm's restoration areas. This includes controlling invasive species and ensuring young trees establish successfully.

---

## Gorse Removal

Control invasive gorse to protect native plantings:

- [ ] Gear up: Wear heavy-duty gloves and grab the loppers
- [ ] Head to the hillside behind the poplars at the top of the farm
- [ ] Cut gorse back to the base and pile it neatly for disposal
- [ ] Work systematically across the designated area
- [ ] Focus on gorse near young trees first
- [ ] Stack cut material away from tree guards

**Safety First:**
- Wear thick gloves - gorse is extremely spiky!
- Use sharp, clean loppers for efficient cutting
- Watch your footing on slopes
- Take regular breaks - it's hard work!
- Never work alone in remote areas

**Gorse Management Tips:**
- Cut as close to ground level as possible
- Mark treated areas to track progress
- Some regrowth is normal - repeat treatments needed
- Pile cut material for later removal/burning

## Young Tree Audit

Check on newly planted trees to ensure their survival:

- [ ] Walk the farm perimeter and check all newly planted trees
- [ ] Check: Are they still alive? Are the protective covers/guards secure?
- [ ] Pull any grass or weeds growing inside the tree guards
- [ ] Straighten any leaning stakes
- [ ] Tighten any loose tree ties
- [ ] Note any trees that need replacement

**What to Look For:**
- **Alive:** Green leaves/buds, flexible branches, healthy bark
- **Dead/Dying:** Brown leaves, brittle branches, damaged bark
- **Guards:** Should be secure, upright, and properly ventilated
- **Weeds:** Competition for water and nutrients - remove completely

**Tree Care Tips:**
- Remove weeds within 50cm radius of each tree
- Ensure guards don't rub against tree bark
- Tree ties should be secure but not too tight
- Water young trees during dry periods if possible

## Recording Observations

Help track restoration progress:

- [ ] Count total number of trees checked
- [ ] Record how many trees are thriving/struggling/dead
- [ ] Note locations of problem areas
- [ ] Take photos if significant changes observed
- [ ] Report findings to farm supervisor

---

## Completion

Once all tasks are completed:
- [ ] Return all tools to proper storage
- [ ] Record work completed in the farm log
- [ ] Report any urgent issues (e.g., many dead trees)
- [ ] Clean gloves and boots
