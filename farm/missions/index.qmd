## About Farm Missions

Farm Missions are regular maintenance and care tasks that anyone can undertake once they have read and followed the instructions on each mission ticklist. Each mission focuses on a specific area of farm management and can be completed independently.

These missions help ensure the ongoing health and productivity of our urban farm while providing hands-on learning opportunities for students.
