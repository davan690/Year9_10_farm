## The Watering Run

Proper watering is essential for plant health:

- [ ] Use the blue bin supply to fill watering cans
- [ ] Deliver at least 2 full cans per raised bed
- [ ] Bonus: Water the herb boxes by the barn
- [ ] Water at the base of plants, avoiding leaves when possible
- [ ] Check soil moisture before watering - should be damp but not soggy

**Watering Tips:**
- Water in early morning or late afternoon to minimize evaporation
- Different plants need different amounts - observe and adjust
- Seedlings need gentle watering to avoid displacement

## Weed & Tend

Maintain the berry house for optimal fruit production:
