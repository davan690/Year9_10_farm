## Overview

Your mission is to observe and document environmental conditions on the farm. These observations help us understand ecosystem health and biodiversity.

## The Stream Study

Water quality and flow are indicators of ecosystem health:

### Observe and Record:

**Visual Assessment:**
- [ ] Look: Is the water clear or murky? Is it flowing fast or slow?
- [ ] Check water level - high, normal, or low?
- [ ] Look for signs of erosion along banks
- [ ] Note any debris or pollution
- [ ] Observe aquatic life (insects, fish, etc.)

**Auditory Assessment:**
- [ ] Listen: Can you hear the water? Describe the sound
- [ ] Can you identify any bird calls nearby?
- [ ] What other sounds do you notice in this area?
- [ ] Is it quieter or noisier than other parts of the farm?

**Sensory Assessment:**
- [ ] Smell & Feel: Does the air smell damp?
- [ ] Is it cooler here than in the open paddock?
- [ ] Is there a breeze? From which direction?
- [ ] How does the vegetation differ near the stream?

**Water Quality Indicators:**
- Clear water = healthy stream
- Murky water = recent rain, erosion, or pollution
- Presence of aquatic insects = good water quality
- Variety of bird species = healthy ecosystem

**Recording Tips:**
- Take photos at the same spot each visit
- Note the date, time, and weather conditions
- Compare your observations to previous visits
- Report any concerns (pollution, dead fish, etc.)

## Bee Watch

Monitor bee activity to understand colony health:

### The Observation Protocol:

**Safety First:**
- [ ] Stand to the side of the hive (stay out of the flight path!)
- [ ] Maintain at least 2 meters distance
- [ ] Move slowly and calmly
- [ ] Don't wear strong perfumes or dark colors
- [ ] Never tap or disturb the hive

**The Minute Count:**
- [ ] Position yourself safely to the side of the entrance
- [ ] Set a timer for 60 seconds
- [ ] Count: How many bees leave the hive in 60 seconds?
- [ ] Count: How many bees return in the same period?
- [ ] Note the weather conditions during your count
- [ ] Record your observations for next week's comparison

**What the Numbers Mean:**
- High activity (50+ bees/minute) = healthy, active colony
- Medium activity (20-50 bees/minute) = normal for cooler weather
- Low activity (<20 bees/minute) = cold weather or potential problem
- More leaving than returning = foraging mission
- More returning than leaving = bringing in resources

**Additional Observations:**
- [ ] Are bees carrying pollen? (Look for yellow/orange on legs)
- [ ] Do bees appear healthy and active?
- [ ] Are there dead bees around the entrance?
- [ ] Is the entrance clear of debris?
- [ ] Any unusual sounds from inside?

## General Environmental Notes

Observe the bigger picture:

- [ ] Note the weather: temperature, wind, cloud cover
- [ ] What wildlife did you see today? (birds, insects, mammals)
- [ ] Are any plants flowering?
- [ ] Any seasonal changes observed?
- [ ] Overall impression of farm ecosystem health

## Completion

Once all observations are recorded:
- [ ] Write up your findings in the observation log
- [ ] Date and sign your entry
- [ ] Compare with previous observations
- [ ] Report any urgent concerns to farm supervisor
- [ ] Discuss interesting findings with classmates
