### Barn & Shed Organisation:

- [ ] Sweep the floors and clear any debris

- [ ] Check that all tools are accounted for
- [ ] Wipe down work surfaces
- [ ] Organize shelves and storage areas
- [ ] Stack bags and containers neatly
- [ ] Remove any rubbish to appropriate bins

**Organisation Principles:**
- A place for everything, everything in its place
- Most-used items should be easiest to access
- Heavy items stored low, light items stored high
- Label storage areas clearly
- Keep walkways clear and safe

---

### Wood Pile Management:

- [ ] Re-stack the wood pile behind the 'toilet' area so it is neat and safe
- [ ] Stack wood in stable rows
- [ ] Keep wood off the ground (use pallets if available)
- [ ] Arrange with bark side up to shed water
- [ ] Remove any rotten or unsafe pieces
- [ ] Ensure pile won't topple over

**Wood Stacking Tips:**
- Crisscross ends for stability
- Lean slightly back against support
- Leave air gaps for drying and ventilation
- Stack away from buildings (fire safety)

### Pot Sort & Storage:

- [ ] Head behind the barn to the pot storage area
- [ ] Sort pots by size (small, medium, large)
- [ ] Stack pots of same size inside each other
- [ ] Remove any broken or damaged pots to recycling
- [ ] Clean pots if needed (remove old soil/debris)
- [ ] Store in a location that won't block access
- [ ] Keep different materials separate (plastic, terracotta, etc.)

**Storage Guidelines:**
- Nest pots to save space
- Store upside down to prevent water collection
- Keep in shaded area to prevent UV damage
- Maintain tidy stacks that won't topple

## Tool Audit

Proper tool maintenance extends their life and ensures safety:

### Cleaning Protocol:
- [ ] Clean all dirt off tools used today
- [ ] Remove mud, sap, and plant material
- [ ] Wipe metal parts with oily rag if rusty
- [ ] Check wooden handles for splinters
- [ ] Sharpen blades if necessary (ask supervisor)

### Storage Protocol:
- [ ] Ensure all watering cans and buckets are stored upside down (to prevent mosquito breeding)
- [ ] Return all equipment to proper storage locations
- [ ] Hang tools on designated hooks/racks
- [ ] Coil hoses neatly
- [ ] Store small tools in labeled containers
- [ ] Place sharp tools safely (blades away from reach)

**Tool Maintenance Tips:**
- Clean tools after each use - dried mud is harder to remove
- Oil metal parts occasionally to prevent rust
- Tighten loose handles before they break
- Report damaged tools immediately
- Don't put tools away dirty or wet
