## Lesson structure (3 lessons)

| Lesson | Focus | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| Lesson 1 | Hazards and safe tool use | Students can name hazards and apply controls. |
| Lesson 2 | Turn over and prep the patch | Soil is loosened and turf is removed. |
| Lesson 3 | Compost, break up soil, level | Patch is composted and ready for planting. |

---

## Practical session: Potato patch prep (40 min)

**Goal:** Turn over and prepare the potato patch for planting by removing grass, loosening soil, and mixing compost.

### Group tasks (20 students total)

| Group | Students | Task focus | Key actions |
|---|---|---|---|
| Group A | 7 | Remove top grass | Lift turf, stack it in a designated pile, clear roots. |
| Group B | 7 | Turn over soil | Use forks/spades to loosen and flip soil to one spade depth. |
| Group C | 6 | Compost and break up soil | Spread compost, break clods, rake level. |

### Timing (40 min)

- 0-5 min: Safety briefing, tool allocation, demo of safe spade/fork use.
- 5-30 min: Group work on tasks.
- 30-35 min: Rotate quick checks, finish edges, tidy stacks.
- 35-40 min: Tool clean-up, wash hands, quick reflection.

### Tools and materials

- Spades (for turf lifting)
- Garden forks (for turning soil)
- Rakes (for leveling)
- Buckets or barrow (for compost)
- Gloves (one pair per student)
- Water bottle and sunscreen (if required)

### Risks and controls

| Risk | Control |
|---|---|
| Blisters or cuts | Gloves required, correct tool grip demo. |
| Tool injuries (spade/fork) | Spacing rule: arm's length plus tool length; tools down when not in use. |
| Trips on uneven ground | Clear walkways; keep tools flat on ground when resting. |
| Manual handling strain | Use knees when lifting turf; share heavy loads. |
| Sun exposure | Hats, sunscreen, water breaks. |

### Extra process ideas

- Mark the patch boundary with string before starting.
- Assign a student as timekeeper for mid-lesson check-in.
- Photograph before/after for reflection or mapping updates.
