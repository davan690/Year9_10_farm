## Introduction

Google My Maps is a free tool for creating a farm plan, measuring distances and areas, and recording work done on the property. This guide helps you map our school farm features and plan future work.

## Learning Goals

- Create a digital farm map using layers.
- Add points, lines, and areas with clear labels.
- Measure distances and paddock areas accurately.
- Export or print a clean map for your workbook.

## 1. Getting Started

1. Go to https://www.google.co.nz/mymaps and sign in to your Google account. If you do not have an account, create one.
2. Click **"Create a new map"**.
3. Click **"Untitled map"** to rename your map (for example, "Kaikorai Valley College School Farm").

---

## 2. Set Up Layers

Layers let you separate existing features from proposed work. You can turn layers on or off using the checkbox next to each layer.

1. Rename the first layer to **Existing**. Use this for current paddocks, dams, fences, buildings, and water points.
2. Click **"Add layer"** and name it **Proposed** for future work such as new planting or fencing.
